title: Benedict Cumberbatch Google Chrome Extension
date: 2013-09-08
summary: In which I get annoyed at google because reasons.

I'll keep this short as I can.

Instead of going to sleep I decided to make a small chrome extension that
changes Benedict Cumberbatch's name. I made this and then realised I can't
upload it to the chrome store because I have to pay to upload anything on there
even if I'm not charging anything for it.

My thoughts were "fuck that".

Instead I've decided to host the plugin myself. However it won't download
properly because "security". In all honesty I suspect it's more to do with that
it's not using the chrome store where they're charging developers. Maybe it
does have something to do with "security" but I find it too coincidental that
the only place where it can be downloaded "securely" requires you to pay google
an entry fee. Thanks but no thanks.

So if you want a chrome extension that does this:

Then you'll have to do the following (Tested on Chrome)

1. Right click [here](http://andwhathave.eu/~afal/benedict_cumberbatch.crx) and
   choose "Save link as" and save it to your computer.
2. Once the file is downloaded go on to chrome menu > Tools > Extensions
3. Drag your saved benedict_cumberbatch.crx to the extensions page.
4. Install as normal.
5. Enjoy as your web browsing becomes 100% better

I'll probably put the source to this on github sometime.
