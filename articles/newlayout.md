summary: In which I boast on how my site contains more ducks than previously

So I didn't really like the style of the old blogging engine I was using so I made one reading up on [some kind of book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019664.do). I can now use markdown to do the posts and have them not break the site or something. It's still looking a bit basic though...

I also notice that I haven't posted in a while. Perhaps I should do that with something I've been working on in JavaScript.
