title: I made Bix! Oh wait no one cares (sadface)

So that JavaScript eh? Such a new cool language that everyone is using because of the nodes and the jqueries. Everyone loves the JavaScripts to put on the websites and making the HTML5. Screw python or ruby (or whatever java I don't know) JavaScript is the new hotness. JavaScript is webscale. I don't know what webscale is but you've got to use it or you're not cool.

You got to use a framework in JavaScript. Frameworks are the cool shit to make your website **pop**. Luckily there's like a billion JavaScript frameworks to choose from. There's backbone, spine, knockout, JavascriptMVC, GWT, Ember, Angular, Batman, Cappuccino etc etc. So many frameworks. But how are there so many and why are there new ones and why are they being made so quickly.

I think I figured out why there's so many JavaScript frameworks though. It's because it's pretty easy to make one. Ok that's a bit of an exaggeration. It's pretty easy if you know what you're doing and you don't care about IE. I know this because I tried to make one one weekend and then improved on it after that and made [Bix](http://www.pieratnine.com/bix/).

Actually I say "if you know what you're doing" but in all honesty I wasn't sure what I was doing was right. I mean I just hacked something together in a weekend and tried asking for feedback on it. Got nothing. So either it's perfect or no one cares about *yet another* JavaScript library.

So I'm releasing it. Pretty sure no one else has done this yet. Oh wait no turns out the [co-founder of github made something similar](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) a year ago, that plus this is the same as Sammy or Davis or whatever other routing library there is out there. I don't know; are people just shitting JavaScript libraries just to prove that $thing can be done in JavaScript? Since node has been out people have been making irc bots and muds and encryption libraries and mp3 encoders and whatever has been already made in every other language.

I'm not angry.. ok I'm a little bit angry. I was hoping that I've done something unique that could be useful but it turns out I just reinvented the wheel; and probably pretty shoddily if that.

I'm kinda reminded of a quote from some programmer from long time ago *"programming is rather thankless. you see your works become replaced by superior works in a year. unable to run at all in a few more."* although with "a year before" instead of "in a year". I just wish that I haven't wasted my time :\\
