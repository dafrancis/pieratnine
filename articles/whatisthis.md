title: So what is this again?
date: 2011-10-29

So yeah, I've decided to keep a blog about the personal projects I'm working on. These things are kinda back burner things and will probably be neglected in a while until someone goes "Hey. What was that secret project you were working on? Have you finished it yet?" at which that point I'll look back at the code sigh at young me and the poor programming mistakes I did and rewrite the whole thing to the point I was at last wondering why did I stop here and then remember that the only person who would ever use this would be me.

So I have a few secret projects. Yes a few. There's no specific one I must confess and neither are about piers or being there at nine. I just wanted a funny name for the domain. I could make a project about piers and nines but that would be silly why would anyone do that?

Despite my projects being "secret" I will mention what some of the projects do. This is for my sake rather than for any of you since I'm more than likely to forget about what I'm doing because I'm lazy like that. I'll probably forget about this blog as well and keep forgetting to update it even though the blogging engine is built in a way where I don't have to log into anything just upload what I have to say with git and there we go. Anyway the projects I have are:

* A parser for checking if a sentence or a string follows a very ancient pattern known by a small group of people in the world.
* A learning tool for young children as well as me trying to relearn piano so I can record myself doing a song that is more than likely be silly and I'll probably be criticised about it
* A thing that looks at words and tells you what words they are in another language or something
* A thing that keeps urls that are posted on various IRC channels I am idling in so I can have a look at them later when I am not at work. (would also be a good indicator of if a link is old or not)

Wow that's a lot. It may not look like a lot but these are ideas that I've had for a while and haven't gotten round to it. I guess that doing a blog like this would therefore get me to do some stuff and even put down here stuff that I've learnt whilst doing that stuff.

Project 1 requires me to learn something non programming related and also natural language processing, Project 2 is probably too big and I'll probably not do it in the end even though I think it's a great idea :(, Project 3 and 4 is like a weekend thing and would probably be done first depending on how things go.

We'll see how it goes. I nearly forgot to finish this blog post even so I doubt I'll stick with it for that long ¬_¬
